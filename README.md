# Heart-Disease-Prediction-with-existing-models-and-new-ML-model
In this project, a new ML model was produced as well as the results for the following classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and the Stacking Ensemble was created and tested.

Further study was done on the article - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-024-19293-7 , and the results were recreated and explored deeply. After recreation, a new ML model was created and further tested for accuracy with evaluation metrics like - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC.
